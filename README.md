This is my approach for the Front end test St genetics.

The idea is to have an app that can let users select different items from a menu
place an order and also see the orders that have been made. 

The projects has to pages: 

- index.js
- orders.js

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
