This is my approach for the Front end test St genetics.

The idea is to have an app that can let users select different items from a menu
place an order and also see the orders that have been made. 

The projects has to pages: 

- index.js
- orders.js

## Getting Started

First, download the repo and then run:
 ```bash 
yarn install
```
After you can proceed and run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Tech stack
- React Js 
- Next Js
- Tailwind CSS (styles)
- Zustand (state management)

## Things that i should have manage better 

- Apply typescript to the project would have improve the development
- there are some ```js location.reload()``` in some actions with more time I could figure it out how to manage the 
state changes
